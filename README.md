## Background

Head First Design Patterns exhorts us **not to reinvent the wheels** unless we plan on learning about the wheels.

So this project is about the **wheels** and it does. Base on the **APawn**, create custom **UActorComponents** for movement and replicate. There is some knowledge about physics and math that you have learned in the university.

## Install

Create one **APawn** class, and create two **UActorComponent** classes for your APawn that you create before. And then copy the code in **GoCart.cpp&h** to the APawn class you create in the last step. Copy the code in **GoCartMovementComponent.cpp&h** and **GoCartMovementReplicator.cpp&h** to the UActorComponent classes respectively.

## Usage

Here are some introductions about each file.
